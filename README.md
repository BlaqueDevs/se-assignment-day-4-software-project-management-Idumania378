## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial in software project management because:
	It maintains client trust.
	Ensures alignment with market opportunities.
	Prevents budget overruns.

Strategies to meet deadlines:
	Setting realistic timelines.
	Breaking the project into manageable tasks.
	Using project management tools like Gantt charts.
	Regularly monitoring progress.
	Effective team communication.


## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
 Effective cost control contributes to project success by:
	Keeping the project financially viable and profitable.
	Preventing unnecessary expenses.
	Allowing better allocation of resources.

	Implementing a contingency fund.
	Using cost management software.
	Clear communication about budget constraints.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile suits projects requiring adaptability (e.g., developing a mobile app).
Waterfall works best for fixed-scope projects (e.g., building a government website).
Agile Methodology:
Advantages: 
	Flexible and adaptable.
	Encourages collaboration.
	Continuous feedback loop.
	Disadvantages: 
	Difficult to predict timelines and costs.
Waterfall Methodology:

	Disadvantages: 
	Inflexible to changes once the project starts.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Best for projects with evolving requirements, eg creating a new mobile app where user feedback shapes features.
Waterfall: Ideal for fixed-scope projects, such as developing a government portal with pre-approved specifications.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Quality Assurance:
	Regular code reviews.
	Automated testing.
	Continuous integration.
	Maintaining clear documentation.
Importance:
	Prevents bugs.
	Enhances user satisfaction.
	Protects company reputation.
	Ensures reliable and client-approved software.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope:
	Clarifies project inclusions and exclusions.
	Prevents scope creep.
	Aligns team efforts with project goals.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
A hierarchical breakdown of tasks and deliverables.
	Helps organize work, assign responsibilities, and track progress.
	Ensures efficient project management.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:
	Keeps tasks organized.
	Ensures team alignment.
	Tracks progress.
Role of Gantt Charts:
	Visualizes timelines.
	Shows task dependencies.
	Highlights milestones.
	Identifies bottlenecks early.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Core issues addressed:
	Inefficient data management.
	Lack of predictive insights for marketing strategies.
Significance to target audience:
	These issues hinder school marketing teams’ strategic planning.
	Solutions empower teams with data-driven insights for better enrollment outcomes

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
	Sets a focused direction for development.
	Prevents scope creep.
	Aligns team efforts.
	Ensures the solution directly addresses user pain points.
